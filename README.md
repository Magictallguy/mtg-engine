### There's nothin' there?! ###
This is still in its early-alpha stages. My plans are to add a form of "Mod Manager" which will allow site owners to install mods from within the game.
Once I've got that up and running, modifications should be pretty straight forward

### How do I get set up? ###

* Download the files from here
* Upload them to your public_html (or htdocs/www)
* Create a database and user
* Go to the URL of wherever you just uploaded them - go through it and fill in the details
* Login

### I found a bug! ###
At this stage, that is to be expected.
If you're able to repair it, please do and submit the fix back. If not, simply open a report here!
